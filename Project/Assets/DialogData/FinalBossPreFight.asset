  - 'MASTER OF PLAYS

    You are a fool to think you can change the fate of these
    sad souls. In the end they will crumble and turn to dust. You are just delaying
    the inevitable. '
  - 'BILLY SHAKESPEARE

    Doest thou not believeth in the potential for changeth?
    Nothing is writ in stone, yet thee standeth hither and gage to lithify thy own
    ideas.'
  - 'MASTER OF PLAYS

    Speak in a normal tongue. Speaking in such of manner does
    not make you the playwright you so idolize. It makes you no less sad than those
    who you so foolishly help. '
  - 'BILLY SHAKESPEARE

    Enough talk! Thou art but a vessel for evil and shalt
    falleth ere mine own blade.'
