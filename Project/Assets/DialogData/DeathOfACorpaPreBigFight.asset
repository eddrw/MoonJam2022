  - 'BILLY SHAKESPEARE

    Corpa, thee has''t to hark to me! The corpa coin shall
    only drive thee and Henry further apart. '
  - 'BILLY SHAKESPEARE

    Thither art many other routes to making wage. Start humble
    with a job at McBorpa''s.'
  - "CORPA\nI can\u2019t work at a McBorpa\u2019s! One of their employees jerked
    off in the freezer."
  - 'BILLY SHAKESPEARE

    McBorpa''s may not beest the most wondrous option.  What
    blinking idiot jerks off in the freezer of a McBorpa''s?'
  - 'CORPA

    I know. What a degenerate.'
  - 'BILLY SHAKESPEARE

    But mine own point still stands. A simple job shall doth
    thee much better than losing thy savings to corpa coin.'
  - 'CORPA

    Corpa Coin is going to blow up big. It is going to make us millionaires,
    and I cannot let you stop me from becoming the richest corpa the world has seen.'
