    Hither we findeth potentially the saddest story yet.
    Poor Manlet hast hath lost his mother to the stout arms of his new step-father,
    Chadimus. '
  - 'BILLY SHAKESPEARE

    A being of such stature of Manlet oft finds it sore to
    compete for attention when matched with someone of Sir Chadimus'' god-sculpted
    physique.'
  - 'BILLY SHAKESPEARE

    Manlet, thee wilt accept yond thy mother hast hath found
    a new love.'
  - "MANLET\nWho goes there? Don\u2019t talk about my mom!"
  - 'BILLY SHAKESPEARE

    I am hither as an ally. Thy mother hast hath found peace
    and thee needs to venture on thy own journey. Thee must nay longer suckle at
    the tit.'
  - "MANLET\nStop talking about my mom, man. It\u2019s cringe."
  - 'BILLY SHAKESPEARE

    Thou art 35 years of age. It is time to venture from
    the nest receiveth a job.'
  - 'MANLET

    I will never do such a thing. You will suffer my wrath!'
