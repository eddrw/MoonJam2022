  dialogue:
  - 'BILLY SHAKESPEARE

    The phantom haunts these corridors.  He is at each moment
    watching lest any actor such as myself begins to wander alone. '
  - 'BILLY SHAKESPEARE

    Disturbed by his own appearance, he lurks through the
    halls preying on the actors who findeth themselves at his mercy.'
  - 'BILLY SHAKESPEARE

    Approach me, apparition. Stand ho sulking through the
    night and bewray to me thy visage.'
  - "PHANTOM\nYou are a fool to approach me alone. Don\u2019t you know the dread
    that follows in my wake?"
  - 'BILLY SHAKESPEARE

    Thou art only a foe of yourself. I am hither to beest
    a friend. '
  - 'PHANTOM

    You are the same as the others who skulk through these halls. You
    would mock my appearance given the chance. Now join those who could not escape
    me!'
