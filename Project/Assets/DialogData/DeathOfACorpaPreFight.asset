  - 'HENRY

    Welcome home from work, I made your favorite chili. Make any big
    NFT sales today?'
  - 'CORPA

    ...'
  - "CORPA\nThere are no sales to be had. The NFT scene is as dry as the Sahara.
    I can\u2019t keep going door to door trying to sell these damned pictures."
  - "CORPA\nI can\u2019t provide for this family off the few degenerates left who
    buy these. "
  - "HENRY\nIt will be alright. My cooking streams are starting to get peoples\u2019
    attention. Together, we will make enough to get by."
  - "CORPA\nHenry\u2026 Smug Illustrated fired me. I just couldn\u2019t sell enough
    to keep my quota. "
  - "CORPA\nI can\u2019t be the corpa I\u2019ve always promised you I would be. I
    don\u2019t deserve you or your delicious anytime chili for 2."
  - 'CORPA

    I have a plan though. There is this new thing called Corpa Coin.
    All I need to do is take some of our savings and invest it into it. We will be
    rich in no time.'
  - "BILLY SHAKESPEARE\nPoor poor Corpa, thee wilt not falleth for the fool\u2019s
    trap yond is the Corpa Coin! Thee shouldst not throweth thy savings into the
    abyss."
  - 'CORPA

    ...Who said that?'
  - 'BILLY SHAKESPEARE

    I am hither to save thee! Only thee can see me. Henry
    is blind to mine own presence. I am hither to bid thee yond thee wilt not throweth
    thy savings into the abyss.'
  - 'CORPA

    You are the demon I was warned of. Corpa Coin is a guaranteed thing.
    Your words only serve to confuse me!'
